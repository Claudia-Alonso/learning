# Set Up
- Python3 --version [to get the version number on Mac]

- If you type `python -v` on the mac terminal, you won't actually be doing the same as if you'd typed `python --version`. Instead you'll go into python *Interpretive mode*. In this mode, ypu can type some python code and it'll come back straight away. The application doesn't need to be compiled before it is run.

~~If you do python -v you're going to do python2 stuff and to get out of there you'll need to type quit() or help() if you want to do some investigating.
I changed the .zprofile so that Python3 --version and Python --version work the same. Just for future, specify the Python3 part if running file from
the command line. Not very sure which version of Python would run if you used Python instead of Python3 (even with the change in the .zprofile)~~
